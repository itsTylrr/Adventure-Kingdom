# Adventure Kingdom

## Overview

This is a small terminal-based game built in Java back in 2023. The game serves as a simple project to experiment with Java programming.

## Game Description

In this game, you play as your own customized character, choosing between a Mage or a Longsword type. The world you explore is endless but repeating. As you venture into the wilderness, you encounter various monsters. Depending on the success of your attacks, you defeat the monsters and continue to the next location. However, you will notice that after a few attempts, you end up at the same exact place. Why?

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Character Types**: Choose between a Mage or a Longsword type.
- **Endless World**: The world is designed to be endless but has a repeating pattern.
- **Combat System**: Engage in battles with monsters using a random damage and random crit rate system. The damage and crit rate are scaled based on your character's statistics during the fight.

## Purpose

This project is primarily a playground to experiment with Java programming. There isn't much to it beyond that, but it provides a fun and interactive way to practice coding skills.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. Clone the repository and compile the Java files to start playing.
